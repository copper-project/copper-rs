Copper is a user-friendly robotics framework designed for creating fast and reliable robots. Copper is to robots what a game engine is for games.

* Easy: Copper offers a high-level configuration system and a natural Rust-first API.

* Fast: Copper uses Rust's zero-cost abstractions and a data-oriented approach to achieve sub-microsecond latency on commodity hardware, avoiding heap allocation during execution.

* Reliable: Copper leverages Rust's ownership, type system, and concurrency model to minimize bugs and ensure thread safety.

## Overview

Copper is a data-oriented runtime with these key components:

* Task Graph: Described in RON, this configures the system's topology, specifying which tasks communicate and setting types for nodes and messages.

* Runtime Generator: This component decides on an execution plan based on the graph's metadata. It preallocates a "Copper List" to maximize sequential memory access during execution.

* Zero-Copy Data Logging: Records all messages between tasks without copying data, ensuring efficient logging.

* Fast Structured Logging: Interns and indexes logging strings at compile time, avoiding runtime string construction and ensuring high-speed textual logging.


## For the impatients

You can generate a project from a template. Check out [copper-templates](templates/README.md).

## How a Copper application looks like, some concepts and insights about how it can be that fast.

Here is a simple example of a task graph in RON:

```RON
(
    tasks: [
        (
            id: "src",                   // this is a friendly name
            type: "FlippingSource",      // This is a Rust struct name for this task see main below
        ),
        (
            id: "gpio",                  // another task, another name
            type: "cu_rp_gpio::RPGpio",  // This is the Rust struct name from another crate
            config: {                    // You can attach config elements to your task
                "pin": 4,
            },
        ),
    ],
     cnx: [
        // Here we simply connect the tasks telling to the framework what type of messages we want to use. 
        (src: "src",  dst: "gpio",   msg: "cu_rp_gpio::RPGpioMsg"),
    ],    
```

Then, on your main.rs:

```rust,no_run

// Your application will be a struct that will hold the runtime, loggers etc.
// This proc macro is where all the runtime generation happens. You can see the code generated by the macro at
// compile time.
#[copper_runtime(config = "copperconfig.ron")]  // this is the ron config we just created.
struct MyApplication {}

// Here we define our own Copper Task
// It will be a source flipping a boolean
pub struct FlippingSource {
    state: bool,
}

// You need to provide at least "new". But you have other hooks in to the Lifecycle you can leverage 
// to maximize your opportunity to not use resources outside of the critical execution path: for example start, stop, 
// pre_process, post_process etc...
impl CuTaskLifecycle for FlippingSource {
    fn new(_config: Option<&copper::config::NodeInstanceConfig>) -> CuResult<Self>
    where
        Self: Sized,
    {
        Ok(Self { state: true })
    }
}

// We implement the CuSrcTask trait for our task as it is a source / driver (with no internal input from Copper itself).
impl CuSrcTask for FlippingSource {
    type Output = RPGpioMsg;

    // Process is called by the runtime at each cycle. It will give:
    // 1. the reference to a monotonic clock
    // 2. a mutable reference to the output message (so no need to allocate of copy anything)
    // 3. a CuResult to handle errors
    fn process(&mut self, clock: &RobotClock, output: &mut CuMsg<Self::Output>) -> CuResult<()> {
        self.state = !self.state;   // Flip our internal state and send the message in our output.
        output.payload = RPGpioMsg {
            on: self.state,
            creation: clock.now().into(),
        };
        Ok(())
    }
}


fn main() {

    // Copper uses a special log format called "unified logger" that is optimized for writing. It stores the messages between tasks 
    // but also the structured logs and telemetry.
    // A log reader can be generated at the same time as the application to convert this format for post processing.
  
    let logger_path = "/tmp/mylogfile.copper";
    
    // This basic setup is a shortcut to get you running. If needed you can check out the content of it and customize it. 
    let copper_ctx =
        basic_copper_setup(&PathBuf::from(logger_path), true).expect("Failed to setup logger.");
        
    // This is the struct logging implementation tailored for Copper.
    // It will store the string away from the application in an index format at compile time.
    // and will store the parameter as an actual field.
    // You can even name those: debug!("This string will not be constructed at runtime at all: my_parameter: {} <- but this will be logged as 1 byte.", my_parameter = 42);  
    debug!("Logger created at {}.", logger_path); 
    
    // A high precision monotonic clock is provided. It can be mocked for testing. 
    // Cloning the clock is cheap and gives you the exact same clock.
    let clock = copper_ctx.clock;  
    
    debug!("Creating application... ");
    let mut application =
        MyApplication::new(clock.clone(), copper_ctx.unified_logger.clone())
            .expect("Failed to create runtime.");
    debug!("Running... starting clock: {}.", clock.now());  // The clock will be displayed with units etc. 
    application.run().expect("Failed to run application.");
    debug!("End of program: {}.", clock.now());
}

```
