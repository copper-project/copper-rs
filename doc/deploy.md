At compile time, `cargo build` or `cargo build -r` will generate 3 artifacts.
1. the actual binary that will run on the target.
2. a log reader that will allow you to read the logs generated by your robots.
3. a string index directory that will be necessary to reconstruct the log strings from the copper binary log file.
