# cu29-logviz

Rerun-based visualization utilities for Copper logs.

This crate provides reusable log visualization helpers that Copper applications
can call from an app-specific `*-logviz` binary.

The default `cu29-logviz` binary is intentionally a placeholder and prints how
to wire `cu29_logviz::run_cli::<YourStampedDataSet>()` in your own app.
