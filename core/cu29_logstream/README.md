# Copper log streaming

`cu29-logstream` gets a robot's execution log to another machine while the robot
is running. Use it to collect logs at a ground station over a link that can lose
packets, or when the robot's onboard log is hard to retrieve.

It sits between Copper's generated runtime and a packet transport:

```text
Robot runtime → logstream sender → UDP / custom transport
                                         ↓
Logreader / replay ← .copper archive ← logstream receiver
```

The sender protects log records with recovery data. The receiver reconstructs
what it can and records explicit gaps for what it cannot. Received archives use
Copper's native format, so your application's normal logreader and replay tools
can read them. Sender work runs off the real-time task path.

## Using it

Enable `cu29/logstream` and configure a `log_streaming` destination in the app's
RON config. Bind a transport implementing `CuStreamTx`; the
[`cu29-logstream-udp`](../../components/res/cu29_logstream_udp) resource supplies UDP
sender and receiver endpoints.

On the receiving side, `SessionRouter` discovers the sender's configuration from
its manifest. Feed its events to `NativeArchive<P>`, where `P` is your application's
generated dataset type. The archive checks that the sender's schema matches and
preserves the received payloads and timestamps.

## What to expect

- Recovery uses bounded memory. Packet loss beyond those bounds leaves gaps.
- A late receiver can resume from a verified keyframe, but cannot recover expired
  history. Replay refuses to cross a gap without a matching keyframe.
- Native archival currently requires the matching application and full-capture
  codec. Use a separate archive path for each sender session.
- Pacing and optional feedback are deferred. The configured bitrate is not yet
  enforced.

Run `just logstream-receiver-check` from the repository root to test reception,
archival, and replay continuity. See the Rust API docs for receiver limits and
event handling.
