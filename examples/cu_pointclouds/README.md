# cu_pointclouds

## Overview

This demonstrates how to use Copper to interface with rerun to visualize its standard pointcloud.

To use it:
```
$ cargo install rerun-cli
$ cargo run   # it will automagically start the cli and show the point cloud in rerun with the default parameters.
```

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain
- Any hardware or services referenced by this example

## Run

```bash
cargo run -p cu-pointclouds
```

## Expected Output

Expect successful startup logs and normal task-loop execution without panics.
